    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
    	I am currently working as a Junior QA Engineer. I have a BSc in Computer Science. I like software automation testing and would like to further my career in this field. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Although I test software professionally, I very much enjoy developing software outside of work and I find the challenges in building software just as fun and engaging as testing it.
    </p>
    <p>
       When I'm not working on software I like to tinker with old computer hardware and build computers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have extensive understanding and knowledge of Linux systems. I started using Ubuntu at university and soon began distro hopping. I went to Manjaro KDE, ZorinOS, Xubuntu, EndeavourOS and finally landed at Arch Linux with the i3 window manager due to its simplicity, low resource requirements and overall minimilist approach.
